# SinglePageApp-AngularJS-DotNet

There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of [MSAL Angular](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/msal-angular-v1/lib/msal-angular). Check it out:

* [Angular single-page application authenticating users with Azure AD using MSAL Angular](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-angular-spa)

If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the master branch, but please know that it's no longer maintained.
